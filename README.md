# Project Overview
- This repository contains beginner quantitative finance projects built with Python, pandas, Numpy, all developed and test in Google Colab.
- Each notebook focuses on a core concept of financial data analysis, from single-stock trends to portfolio optimization.

1. Stock Price Analysis
  - Nvidia (NVDA)
  - Tesla (TSLA)
  - Ondas (ONDS)
  - Applied Digital (APLD)
  - Navitas Semicondutor (NVTS)
  - Perpetua Resources Corp. (PPTA)
  - Richtech Robotics (RR)
Key features: 
  - Downloaded data using yfinance.
  - Calculated daily returns and 20-day moving averages.
  - Visualized stock trends and volatility using matplotlib.

2. Portfolio Optimization
- Simulated and analyzed a 7-stock portfolio to find the best allocation between return and risk.
Key concepts covered:
  - Random portfolio generation.
  - Annualized returns and volatility.
  - Efficient Frontier and Sharpe Ratio
  - Visualization of risk return tradeoffs

3. Tools and libraries 
Python: Main programming language
